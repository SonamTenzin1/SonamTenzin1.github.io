### Topic: Student Data Management System ER Model
---

The ER model that we presented during the flipped class was inspired by the VLE(Virtual Learning Environment) of our class. In our model, our primary key was the Admin_ID because the Admin_ID is unique.  While drawing the ER model, I understood why it is important to assign a primary key and where to assign a primary key. I also learned how to know the relationship between the entities and that a weak entity should be accompanied by a weak relation. After the session, I had a better understanding of ER models and how they are applied in our day to day life.

We were divided into 6 groups with 4 members in each. Then we were assigned a topic and the topic that my group got was the Student Management System. Our ER model was inspired from VLE since it was closely related Student Data Management System. We were given total of 50 minutes to draw our ER model and 10 minutes to present it to the class.We presented about how our ER model worked and the relation type between the entities and then the presentation was followed up by question-answer session which helped us improve our model.

The flipped was very fun and interactive and the question-answer session made it even more enjoyable. The session made the theories that we were taught clearer and and we had a better understanding of the concepts.
