### Topic: NoSQL database

### Sub-topic: document based database
---
A document-based database is a type of nonrelational database that stores data in documents rather than rows and columns. These documents are typically in JSON, BSON, or XML. Documents in this type of database can be easily stored and retrieved in a way that closely resembles the data objects used in applications, reducing the need for data translation. 

Key features of document databases include:
- flexible schema, making it easy to store documents with varying structures
- faster creation and maintenance due to minimal schema requirements
- lack of foreign keys, as there are no dynamic relationships between documents 
- and the use of open formats like XML and JSON for document construction.

### Sub-topic: key-value store
---
A key-value store is a type of nonrelational database, representing the simplest form of NoSQL databases. In this database, data elements are stored as key-value pairs, with each element having a unique key for retrieval. Values can range from simple data types like strings and numbers to complex objects. Key-value stores resemble relational databases with just two columns: one for the key and one for the corresponding value.

Key features of key-value stores include:
- simplicity in design and usage, 
- scalability to handle large amounts of data and traffic, 
- and high speed in data retrieval and storage operations.
