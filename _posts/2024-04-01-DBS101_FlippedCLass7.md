Building a relational database from the scratch requires careful planning. The first step is to define the purpose and target users. What information will the database store and who can access to it? This clarifies what data to collect and how to organize it.

Next, analyzing the data requirements. What specific details need to captured and how they will be used? Existing data sources loke spreadsheets can be a starting point.

Once the data requirements are clear, identify entities and attributes. Entities are the main categories of data and the attributes are their specific details. This list forms the foundation of the database structure.

The actual structure involves modeling tables and fields. Each entity becomes a separate table with its attributes as individual fields. In this section, data types like text , number or date are assigned. Visual tools llike ERD can be used.

Finally establish relation between the tables. Relational database link tables through foreign keys. This minimizes data duplication and ensures accuracy.
