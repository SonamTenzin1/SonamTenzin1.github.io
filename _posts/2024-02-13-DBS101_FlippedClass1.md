### Topic: Database Users and Database Administrator
---

In the database system, there are administrator and 7 different types of database users. Database administrator is responsible for recovery,backup and technical support of the database. The administrator owns an account in the database which is called a system account or superuser account. Administrator also looks after the damage of the hardware and software of the database system and has the ability to grant access or revoke access to the database. The first type of users is called the Naive users who does not possess the knowledge of database but frequently uses the database. Second type of users are called the System Analyst who fulfill the requirements of the naive users. Following the list, we have the Sophisticated users who has the knowledge of database but doesn't interact with the database but only interacts using SQL (Structured query language). Then we have the Database designers who designs the structure of the database. Application Programmers are the fifth type of user in the database who creates the back-end and writes code for the application. Casual/Temporary users are the ones who occasionally uses the database but they require new information every time. The last of users are called the Speacialized users because they write specialized database applications.

We were intially divided into 4 groups with 6 members each. Then we were assigned a topic to discuss about and the discussion lasted for 20 minutes. After discussion, we were again divided into 4 groups each with 6 members and it was called the Home group. In the home group, we individually shared what we have discussed in the initial group and after we were done sharing what we leanrt, one member from each group had to answer the question given by our tutor and our group was asked about the roles of the administrators.

The flipped class was interesting and enjoyable. However, there were some issues regarding the groupings as it seemed like some bright students were altogether while others did not and I felt the need of a group captain to initiate the discussions and make sure everyone is on the same page as it appeared that some certain students needed extra help as the group they were in did not elaborate on the topic they were supposed to.
